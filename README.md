This HTML code creates a 3D portfolio website using plain HTML, CSS, and Three.js.

At the top, it has a description section introducing who I am and what the site is about.

A 3D animated background (canvas) is rendered with Three.js, giving the site a modern, interactive feel.

On the right side, there is an info box containing my name, title, skills, and a contact button.

The layout is fully responsive, styled with CSS, and designed to look clean and professional.

In short, the code combines 3D visuals + personal branding to create an interactive portfolio experience.
